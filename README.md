# BUNDLE BEE

Bundle Bee is an intuitive program that ingests your React project and instantiates an interactive analysis tool to help you compare your bundle composition, speed times and file sizes.  Currently compatible with Webpack, Parcel and Rollup - our program will give you the needed configuration files to get started with whichever suits your needs.

### Getting Started: _Auto-config your webpack, parcel & rollup build tools._

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
